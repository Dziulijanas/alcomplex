History
The following mandatory text should be given to the candidate for the history
page.
The Active Leisure Complex was built in 2005 so is a relatively new complex
with up to date state of the art facilities. It was opened in June 2005 by the
Mayor of Berwick, John Sunderland and provides a centre piece for the
community.
The ground on which it was built previously housed the Franklin Monastery
which was demolished in 1998 after years of lying in a state of disrepair. A
plaque outside the leisure complex marks the spot where the monastery once
stood.
